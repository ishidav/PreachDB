Regards preach v1.31:

1) Updating your local area:

  <$PREACH_PATH> cvs update -A -d

2) Getting a fresh copy of preach: (optional)

  <work_directory> cvs get -A preach


3) Add the following to your $PATH (you should do it in you .cshrc right after the line where
you have defined PREACH_PATH):

setenv PATH  $PREACH_PATH/SCRIPTS:$PATH 


4) To run:

you need to have a hosts file in which each line has the following strict format:

nodename1.
nodename2.

where nodename* is the node's short-name, e.g., fossa, avahi. Node the 'dot' after the name. 

go to the peterson directory or german and type

ptest --module=n5_peterson_modified

or 

ptest --module=german4

or 

ptest --help for info


ptest should be the only way we want to run PReach, so I'm not going to write directions on how not to use ptest.
Just remember that if you don't want to run in distributed mode you can pass --local to ptest (see ptest --help)
